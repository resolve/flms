FLMS is a CMS for web pages that use interactive layers to present animated content.  Essentially, it is an easy way to leverage the excellent [skrollr.js library](https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr), included in this plugin. Creating the numerous data-xxxx styling tags to animate skrollr content gets tedious quickly, so FLMS automates the task.

Via the CMS, users can create 'layers' containing various types of rich content:
* Basic images (uploader included)
* Text banners
* Paragraphs with headings
* Embedded HTML (useful for things like YouTube videos and the like)
* Animated images (sprited animations that progress as the viewer scrolls)

The end result: create animated, parallax-scrolling sites via a CMS without needing to write a line of code.  So sweet.

Setup
-----

Add the engine to your Rails app Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'flms'
```

Then run:

    $ bundle install

FLMS is now installed, now we need to tell your Rails app about its routes, add this block to config/routes.rb

```ruby
mount Flms::Engine => "/flms"
```

FLMS uses [Carrierwave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) to host assets.  Create config/s3.yml and fill in your s3 credentials (example below):

```ruby
development:
  bucket: YOUR_BUCKET_ID
  access_key_id: YOUR_KEY_ID
  secret_access_key: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  cdn_url: YOUR_CDN_URL *optional

test:
  bucket: YOUR_BUCKET_ID
  access_key_id: YOUR_KEY_ID
  secret_access_key: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  cdn_url: YOUR_CDN_URL *optional

production:
  bucket: YOUR_BUCKET_ID
  access_key_id: YOUR_KEY_ID
  secret_access_key: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  cdn_url: YOUR_CDN_URL *optional
```
FLMS automatically creates a config/s3.yml.example file in your app if you do not have one already.

(For local development Carrierwave will use the local filesystem by default.)

Install FLMS-related migrations to the host app and run them:

    rake flms:install:migrations
    rake db:migrate

Create a user:

    rake flms:create_user[YourEmailAddressHere@example.com]

...start your rails server, and you can log in at 0.0.0.0:3000/flms/login.

Basic Concepts
==============

FLMS includes a built-in user authentication built via Devise, and the FLMS CMS pages all require login (with a few exceptions as noted below).  The intent is to allow users to get up and running quickly with a usable CMS in a minimum of fuss.

FLMS includes the Carrierwave gem for handling file uploads.

Content in FLMS is built around the following core models: Layers, Blocks, and Pages.

Layers
------

The primary content model is the layer.  A layer in the most basic sense is a HTML DIV element that is animated via a series of  keyframes (i.e., snapshots of CSS properties).  The DIV can contain any content desired, although FLMS provides some basic layer types that provide an easy shortcut for creating basic animations.

The following 'simplified' layer types are provided by FLMS:
* Image: a simple div containing an uploaded image as the background-image.
* Text: a textual string, with controls for text size and color.
* Paragraph: a 'descriptive' block of text, with a header and body copy.
* Embed: allows users to embed arbitrary HTML, very useful for things like video elements from YouTube.
* Animation: users can upload an image containing animation frames vertically stitched together as a sprite, and specify how 'playback' of the animation frames is performed as the user scrolls.

These layer types simplify the process of creating animations by placing some constraints on how the animations are constructed. Specifically, the layers contain only three keyframes, to specify the beginning ('start'), middle ('target'), and final ('end') state of the layer.  The keyframes allow for animation of a small set of common CSS attributes.  Even with these constraints, a wide variety of animations can be created.

In addition to these types, FLMS provides an 'advanced' layer type that allows for an arbitrary number of keyframes and much greater power in CSS animation.

Blocks
------

A block is a collection of layers.  By definition parallax scrolling requires the differing movement of several layers simultaneously, so FLMS collects a set of layers within a block.  Blocks are identified by both a CSS name and human-friendly name, and can be given a thumbnail identifier image.

Pages
-----

A page is given a name and a URL, and houses a collection of blocks, which are shown to the user in sequence as they scroll down the body of the page.

Pages provide a convenient endpoint for populating content into the host Rails app - simply add the following catch-all line to your routes.rb file in the host app to show FLMS pages as if they were full-fledged elements of your site:

    match '*id' => 'flms/pages#show'

Customization
==============

You can customize the views and or assets of FLMS in your app with either of the following rake commands:

    rake flms:generate:views

or

    rake flms:generate:assets

These commands allow you to edit the styles and or views in your app.  Views will appear in 'app/views/flms', assets in 'app/assets/flms'.  When using assets remember to require the stylesheets in application.css with the following line:

    *= require_directory ./flms

To undo the generators use the respective commands as listed below:

    rake flms:destroy:views

or

    rake flms:destroy:assets

to remove the added views or assets from you application.


Development
=============

Contributions are very welcome! Fortunately Developing for FLMS is a breeze due to it's TDD nature:

* First fork the repository [here](https://github.com/Originate/flms).

* Check out your local fork, make changes.

* run:

    $ rspec

To make sure all tests pass.

* Submit changes as pull requests with test coverage.
